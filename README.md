This was a simple task using SQL and the Chinook database.

The objective of the task was to use SQL Queries.

To answer a set of important questions such as:
- What are the best-selling products?
- What is the total revenue in each country?
- How is the monthly sales performance?
- Who are the top customers?

The steps I worked on were as follows:
Exploring the database:
- Main tables (Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track)
- I understood the relationships between them through keys (Primary / Foreign Keys).

Writing SQL Queries:
- Calculating total revenue by country using a JOIN between Invoice and InvoiceLine.
- Extracting the Top 10 Products by number of sales.
- Analyzing revenue and number of invoices monthly using strftime() for time conversion.
- Displaying sales details for each customer by linking 4 tables together (Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track).
